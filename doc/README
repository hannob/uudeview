This directory contains the documentation of the UUDeview Decoding
Library programming interface. It is of interest only if you want
to use the decoding/encoding functions from your own applications,
and is not intended for users of the ready-made programs.

The documentation is distributed in LaTeX format (requiring LaTeX
version 2e). You can request Postscript and HTML formatted files
from the author by email. Please understand that I cannot provide
printed documentation.

If you have LaTeX 2e installed, just run make to compile the text
into a DVI file, which can be viewed with xdvi. Run 'make ps' to
create a printable Postscript document.

Even if you can't read the doc, you can take a look at the sample
C files (they show the "evolution" of the "Trivial Decoder") to
see how easy it is to include decoding support into your programs.
