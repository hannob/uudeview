                               UUDEVIEW FOR UNIX
                                 Version 0.5.20

     Welcome to UUDeview, a package of a very smart decoder and an
     encoder for Base64 (MIME), uuencoded, xxencoded and Binhex files.   
     Its ultimate goal is to fully replace the "standard", but dumb
     uudecode and uuencode utilities.
     
Introduction

   If you're into emailing and reading news, you have already learned how
   difficult it is to distribute or receive binary files by this means.
   You will have noticed that you must frequently edit files before
   decoding them, and make sure they're in the right order. Here's a tool
   to free you of these permanent bothers. The package features a smart
   decoder, UUDeview, which allows for comfortable decoding of about
   anything you feed into it. It reads in a bunch of files, sorts the
   individual postings or emails and lets you choose which files to
   decode. You will also find the equally helpful UUEnview, which not
   only encodes binaries for sending, but automatically sends them, too.
   
   The decoder supports the four encoding methods uuencoding, xxencoding,
   Base64 (from the MIME standard) and BinHex, the encoder can encode to
   all of them except to BinHex. When encoding, you can choose the method
   with a command-line option, and the decoder auto-detects all of them.

   The frontend programs are built around a powerful decoding library,
   which can be easily integrated into other applications as well. You
   can find LaTeX documentation in the doc/ subdirectory, Postscript
   and HTML-formatted files can be requested from the author (email
   only).

   This piece of software wouldn't be what it is today without the help,
   encouragement, suggestions and bugreports from a number of people. I
   especially want to thank Michael Newcomb, Nico Mak, Stephane Barizien,
   Kris Karas and Joachim Meyn for their support.
   My apologies to the people I forgot to mention.
